## Introduction

This open source repository contains functional ADTs built in TypeScript. These adts can be used to
compose functionality together in a lazy loaded fashion keeping the logic pure. The `AsyncReader` ADT 
combines the `Reader` ADT and the `Async` ADT to create a promised based composable pipeline. The 
`AsyncReader` is the most common used ADT from this library.
